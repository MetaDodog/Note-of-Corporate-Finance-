I major in accounting, which is a very professional subject. It's like a craft. I know to be a good craftsman I need to hone my craft every now and then. This requires a deep understainding of many subjects and corporate finance is defintely one of them.   
I decide to modify the textbook according to my understanding. By doing so I can integrate the wisdom of the professors into my own knowledge structure.   
I know the knowledge from this textbook is not enough, but it will act like the foundation, which provides a basic structure with many concepts in it. After that, I can add other knowledge to modify the structure.   
As for why I choose to keep this note open, there are primarily two reasons:  
* To teach is the best way to learn.
* To comunicate with others is the best way to test your work.         

So welcome to discuss with me about this interesting topic.
