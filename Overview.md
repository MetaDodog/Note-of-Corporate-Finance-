# Background Info
Economic Activity    
* The basic structure of economic activity(How to organize economic Activity )    

# Part Zero: the Structure    
* Asset = Debt + Equity     
This equation is in the perspective of the ownership of the assets.    
* **Investing** should be matched with **Financing**   

# Part One: Asset   
From the perspective of *how long the assets will last*, **assets** can be classified as   
* Fixed Assets 
* Current Assets   
```
1.为什么要这样分类？这样分类的意义是什么？    
2.assets到底是什么？从经济学的角度上看？     
```
From the perspective of ??, **fixed assets** can be calssified as   
* Tangible Assets 
* Intangible Assets    
```
1.只有fixed assets才有tangible 和intangible之分吗？为什么current assets没有tangible和intangible之分？           
2.tangible的定义到底是什么？       
3.进一步的，定义是怎么来的？有明确的文档说明吗？如果有，是什么文档？在哪里可以看到最新的说明文档。       
4.定义有哪几种？     
```   

# Part Two: Debt & Equity  
From the perspective of *how long the debt will last*, **debt** can be devided into   
* Current Liablity   
* Long-term Debt   
```
1.这样分类的意义在于什么？    
```
**Equity** represents the difference between the value of assets and the debt of the firm. It's a residual claim on the firm's assets.    

# Three Basic Activity    
* **Capital Budgeting**: making and managing expenditures on long-lived assets    
* Adjusting **Capital Structure**  
* Managing **Net Working Capital**: current assets minus current liablities   

These activities fall in the realm of the **finance activity**   

When we talk about an activity, one important part is how to organize people to do that activity. Here is the **organization structure** of the finance activity.    
1.Board of Directors
2.CEO
3.CFO
4.1Treasurer    
4.2Controller    
```
这俩的区别是啥，没搞明白
```

# Business Types 
Businesses can take many forms.    
## why bother?
It influences everything from day-to-day operations, to taxes and to how much of your personal assets are at risk.   
You should choose one which gives you the right balance of **legal protections and benefit**. 

```
不同是什么？-->怎么分类？-->分类的点肯定是值得关注的点-->所以这又回到了什么是business中值得关注的点这个问题
